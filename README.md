## Overview
`aurora-unicycler` defines a universal battery cycling protocol that can be exported to different formats.

## Features
- Define a cycling protocol based on a Python Pydantic model, with validation
- Save a unicycler protocol as a human-readable .json
- Export protocols into different formats:
  - Biologic .mps
  - Neware .xml
  - tomato 0.2.3 .json
  - PyBaMM string list

This is particularly useful for high-throughput battery experiments, as protocols can be programmatically defined, and sample IDs and capacities can be attached at the last second.

Check out our standalone APIs for controlling cyclers with Python or command line:
 - [`aurora-biologic`](https://github.com/empaeconversion/aurora-biologic)
 - [`aurora-neware`](https://github.com/empaeconversion/aurora-neware)

We also have a full application with a GUI, including a graphical interface to create these protocols:
- [`aurora-cycler-manager`](https://github.com/empaeconversion/aurora-cycler-manager)

## Installation

Install on Python >3.10 with
```
pip install aurora-unicycler
```

## Usage

Define a protocol using Python
```python
from aurora-unicycler import *

my_protocol = Protocol(
    measurement= MeasurementParams(
        time_s=10,
        voltage_V = 4.2,
    ),
    safety= SafetyParams(
        max_voltage_V = 5,
        min_voltage_V = 0,
        max_current_mA = 10,
        min_current_mA = -10,
    ),
    method = [
        Tag(
            tag="my_tag",
        ),
        ConstantCurrent(
            rate_C=0.5,
            until_voltage_V=4.2,
            until_time_s=3*60*60,
        ),
        ConstantVoltage(
            voltage_V=4.2,
            until_rate_C=0.05,
            until_time_s=60*60,
        ),
        ConstantCurrent(
            rate_C=-0.5,
            until_voltage_V=3.5,
            until_time_s=3*60*60,
        ),
        Loop(
            start_step="my_tag",
            cycle_count=100,
        )
    ]
)
```

You can then attach a sample name and capacity and convert to other formats, for example:
```python
mps_string = my_protocol.to_biologic_mps(
    sample_name="test-sample",
    capacity_mAh=45,
    save_path="some/location/settings.mps"
)
```
